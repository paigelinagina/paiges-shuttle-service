<h1>Pricing and Fees</h1>
<p class="paragraphStyle">Please check my availability before submitting a ride request. This can be accomplished by clicking over to the availability tab. Any ride requests for a time that is not offered will be denied. Please note that no rides will be offered between 12AM and 5:30AM under any circumstance, but my availability will change from week to week, so check it every time you request a ride. You will be notified of whether or not your ride request has been approved within 24 hours maximum and likely much earlier via your preferred mode of contact.</p>
