<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>


<h2> How and when do I pay you? </h2>	
	<p class="paragraphStyle">  I accept cash, Venmo or Square Payment by card the same day of the ride. Alternative payments can be arranged, but "forgetting to get money" is unacceptable. Failure to ask for alternative payment options at the beginning of a ride or to complete your payment within 15 minutes of the ride via Venmo may result in a ban from using my service. </p>
	
	<h2> Where will you drive me? </h2>
	<p class="paragraphStyle"> Typically I only drive to and from New Haven Union Station, Bradley International Airport and Hartford bus terminal. I DO NOT typically drive to other locaions in New Haven. If you wish to go to Yale's campus, one of the specialty grocery stores or other locations, you MUST tell me before the ride begins--in your ride request, preferably. There will likely be an extra cost associated with this. Locations outside of a 30 mile radius will most likely be denied unless I am explicitly offering rides to Providence, Rhode Island. Rides to JFK or La Guardia will not be considered--period. </p>
	
	<h2> When will you drive me? Do you make exceptions? </h2>
	<p class="paragraphStyle"> I will only drive during the times listed under the Availability tab, but bear in mind that my availability may change from week to week. No rides will be offered between midnight and 5:30 AM under any circumstance, but additional times may be offered before, during and after breaks. If you ask for a ride more than 2 weeks in advance, I will likely not be able to give you a definitive answer about whether or not it can be accomodated.</p>
	
	<h2> How much do you charge? </h2>
	<p class="paragraphStyle"> All prices will be listed under the Pricing tab. Low income students typically can receieve 30% off. Extenuating circumstances may alter this price further, however. </p>
	
	<h2> What are the extra fees? </h2>
	<p class="paragraphStyle"> Extra fees are exactly what they sound like--fees you will incur for being extra. This includes being more than ten minutes late to a ride, asking for a ride with less than 6 hours of notice given and/or asking for a ride out of the typical range. </p>
	
	<h2> Where will you pick me up or drop me off? </h2>
	<p class="paragraphStyle"> I will drop you off and pick you up at the location of your choosing--please specify in the form. Specifically, I will pick you up from the ARRIVALS level of Bradley International Airport. </p>
	
	<h2> What does your car look like? </h2>
	<p class="paragraphStyle"> I drive a purplish, gray Ford Fiesta with a Texas license plate. </p>

	<h2>Why was my ride request rejected? </h2>
	<p class="paragraphStyle">  I can refuse to offer a ride for any number of reasons.</p>
	<p class="paragraphStyle">You're rude: I will not tolerate anyone being rude to me. This includes harassing me about my prices. I explicitly offer discounts to anyone who asks. If you don't like my pricing or fees, you can find an alternative ride. You are never entitled to a ride or my time. </p>
	 <p class="paragraphStyle">Inclement Weather: I will not ride in dangerous conditions or during travel bans under any circumstance. Although I have experience driving in poor conditions, I will not drive in heavy snowfall or ice. (see below) </p>
	<p class="paragraphStyle">You asked for a ride when I am not offering rides: Please remember to check my availability before sending a request. </p>
	
<h2>Are you sure you can't drive me? It's not snowing very much.</h2>

<p class="paragraphStyle">I actually have a very low cancelation rate, so if I canceled your ride there is likely a good reason. Driving in the ice is not only dangerous, but damaging to my car. Please do not argue with me about my decision to cancel for weather related reasons, or any reason at all. Uncordial behavior such as this may result in a ban from my service. </p>
	
	<h2>How many people have you given rides to?</h2>
	<p class="paragraphStyle">183 as of May 30th. Check back often for rides offered to new or previous riders!</p>
	
<h2>Anything else?</h2> 

<p class="paragraphStyle">I offer discounts when I myself am visiting New York via Union Station or going to New Haven in general. These opportunities will be listed in the WesRides page.</p>
